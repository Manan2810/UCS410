#The organization has an analysis to perform and one of the basic assumption of that
#analysis is that the data should be normally distributed.
#You have the following tasks to do:
#  (a) Import the csv data file in R.
data <- read.csv(file = "/Users/mananmehra/Downloads/Clt-data.csv")
#(b) Validate data for correctness by counting number of rows and viewing the top
no_of_rows=nrow(data)
head(data,10)
#ten rows of the dataset.
#(c) Calculate the population mean and plot the observations by making a histogram.
mean(data$Wall.Thickness)
hist(data$Wall.Thickness)
#(d) Mark the mean computed in last step by using the function abline.
abline(v = mean(data$Wall.Thickness), col = "red", lwd = 2)
#See the red vertical line in the histogram? Thatâ€™s the population mean. Comment on
#whether the data is normally distributed or not?
#  Now perform the following tasks:
#  (a) Draw sufficient samples of size 10, calculate their means, and plot them in R
#by making histogram. Do you get a normal distribution.

#(b) Now repeat the same with sample size 50, 500 and 9000. Can you comment on
#what you observe.

#Here, we get a good bell-shaped curve and the sampling distribution approaches
#normal distribution as the sample sizes increase. Therefore, we can recommend the
#organization to use sampling distributions of mean for further analysis.
